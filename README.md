## Team Information
- **Course**: COMP 3004

## Team Members and Roles
- **Affan Husain Beg (101182533)**: Group Leader, System Architecture
  
## Project Overview
This project, developed for COMP 3004, is an Elevator Control System (ECS) designed to handle multiple use cases in an elevator environment. It features a comprehensive system that manages elevator requests, emergency situations, door obstacles, weight overload, fire alarms, and power outages.

## Key Features
- **Request Handling**: Manages elevator requests efficiently, prioritizing based on current status and demand.
- **Emergency Response**: Includes features like an emergency intercom system for immediate assistance.
- **Safety Measures**: Detects obstacles, prevents door accidents, and handles overload scenarios.
- **Fire Alarm and Power Outage Response**: Ensures passenger safety during fire emergencies and power outages.

## Use Cases
- **Request Elevator**: Allows passengers to call the elevator and choose their floor.
- **Emergency Help**: Provides a mechanism for passengers to seek help in emergencies.
- **Door Obstacle**: Detects and responds to obstacles blocking the elevator doors.
- **Overload Alarm**: Alerts when the elevator exceeds its weight limit.
- **Fire Alarm Response**: Coordinates elevator response during fire alarms.
- **Power Outage Handling**: Manages elevator functionality during power outages.

## Installation and Usage
1. **Setup**: 
    - Ensure you have a Qt environment set up for simulation.
    - Clone the repository and open the project in Qt Creator.
2. **Running the System**:
    - Build and run the project in Qt Creator.
    - Use the interface to simulate different elevator scenarios.
